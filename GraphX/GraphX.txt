# GraphX is a library for graph algorithms
# Datasets: Linked webpages, social networks
# Pros: abstraction, performance(RDDs and in-memory computation)
# Only can be used by Scala; Pythpn- GraphFrames

# (1)Vertices: characters
#    - Size of vertice is proportional to the number of times the character appears in any comic book
#    - The dataframe must have a id field, other fields must be left to the id field
# (2)Edges: a relationship between two characters
#    - Edge weight is proportional to the number of times the characters appear together
#    - co-occurence network
#    - must have a src and dst field 

# A DataFrame is like a in-memory table: Vertices DataFrame, Edges DataFrame
